  <h2>Hey neighbors! ðŸ‘‹</h2>
  <p>We're firing up the grill this <strong>Saturday at 4 PM</strong> and would love for you to join us for a backyard barbecue!</p>
  <p>Thereâ€™ll be good food, cold drinks, and great company. Bring whatever youâ€™d like to throw on the grill, a side or drink to share if youâ€™d like, and any friends or family who are around.</p>
  <p>Itâ€™ll be at our place â€” just follow the delicious smell of barbecue! Let us know if you can make it. Hope to see you there!</p>
  <p>Cheers,<br>
  <em>[Your Name / Your Familyâ€™s Name]</em></p>
